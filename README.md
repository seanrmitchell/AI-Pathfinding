# AI Pathfinding

Researching and learning how search algorithms execute the shortest and quickest paths in games an beyond, using A* and Dijkstra in Unity. 

#### A*
Informed heuristic algorithm commonly found in game engines today--such as Unity. Has been the industry standard for multiple decades

#### Dijkstra
Typically uninformed search algorithm that searches wide for the target. Similar to A*, but lacks a heuristic, and is not commonly used in games but is popular in other settings like direction applications.
